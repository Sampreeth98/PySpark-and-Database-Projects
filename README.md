# Neural Networks Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the Neural Networks Projects repository! This repository contains code and documentation for various neural network projects. Our primary focus is on tasks such as classification, regression, and other machine learning tasks using neural networks and related techniques.

## Project Description
One of the projects included in this repository entails visualizing and engineering the dataset for bank churn prediction. It compares Artificial Neural Networks and Autoencoders with traditional models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Ensemble techniques combine multiple models to achieve optimal performance in predicting bank churn, emphasizing accuracy and reliability.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: This directory contains datasets used in the projects.
- **code/**: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **documentation/**: Contains documentation related to the projects, including reports and technical specifications.
- **results/**: Contains the output or results generated from data processing and analysis.
